# Fast adaptive minorization-maximization procedure for beamforming design of downlink NOMA systems

This capsule contains the simulation code presented in the following scientific paper:

Oisin Lyons, Muhammad Fainan Hanif, Markku Juntti, Le-Nam Tran, "Fast adaptive minorization-maximization procedure for beamforming design of downlink NOMA systems," IEEE Trans. Veh. Technol., vol. 69, no. 7, pp. 8023-8027, Jul. 2020.

# Instructions
The Matlab code makes use of [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io/) as a parser and [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as the internal convex conic solver for speed.

We also publish the codes on [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/5900219/tree/v2) where you can run them online without the need to install the required packages.
